Sentiment analysis for college football tweets


This code is a rough program for streaming and analyzing twitter data for NFL football games and matchups.

Note:
stream_and_analyze.py currently does not work for Windows, as os.fork() is not supported.

This documentation sucks because it is largely a personal project and I apologize. If you're interested in anything about it, please contact me.
