 The #Redskins QB rotation seems obvious for first game. Make sure Colt is ready and physically able. Then Keenum as he's picking up the O. Then Haskins to watch the other 2.

 @balloon_doggy @Ravens I expect the @Ravens game 3 OL starters will likely start the season.  They don't want any starters to be used in game 4 typically.  That will allow for almost 3 weeks of playing together prior to the opener. #RavensFlock, RavensFlock,-0.19333333333333333, 2019-08-05 12:24:38

 This snap really encapsulates how stupid good Tyron Smith is to me. Robert Quinn lands a cross chop - not perfect hand placement but good enough to work against a lot of OTs.

 No way can we have Sørensen starting FS absolutely no chance I will be seriously worried if Thornhill or anyone else doesnt overtake him.

 Because Booker is already a great pass catcher and route runner out the backfield and unlike Riddick he can pound it between the tackles.

 Brady hitting free agency would be absolutely insane and there's a part in me that wants to see what happens.That being said unless he completely falls off the cliff this year – unlikely given his track record – there is no chance he plays elsewhere than New England in 2020., ,-0.1106060606060606, 2019-08-05 18:46:30
 Just some creative language here. Brady will get paid as a free agent every year here on out which means he could end up making more than those tags. Franchise tag and transition tags for 2019 QB's $24.8 million and $22.8 million respectively, ,0.35, 2019-08-05 18:46:32

 So I'll explain - yes today was a bit slow and there were parts that made Nagy unhappy. However in terms of player performance it was their best day.

 I also thought Pagano threw some exotic blitzes at the O that for the most part the OL handled well and 10 handled them really well.Was the pace great? No and that's what Nagy didn't like.

 Thought I had a pretty good grasp of NFL contracts but this is super confusing. I’m guessing some or most of the 2019 money is in a signing bonus and so Brady retires after this year and the pats take a dead cap hit in 2020 and 2021., ,0.21388888888888888, 2019-08-05 19:05:30

 Takeaways from today’s #BearsCamp:1. This was Trubisky’s best day. He was consistently on the money - not just throwing catchable balls (one of @PFF’s biggest gripes) but hitting guys in stride putting the ball exactly where it needs to be. #Bears, BearsCamp Bears,0.5, 2019-08-05 19:18:31
 2. His velocity and timing were also excellent. I used the word “dart” more than once today because that’s what he was throwing. The one thing missing: deep balls. He hit downfield passes but very few (if any) 9 routes. Something to watch for tomorrow. #Bears, Bears,0.20800000000000002, 2019-08-05 19:18:32
 3. Buster Skrine mighta been the star of the show on defense. He was flying around out there getting to and tipping footballs faster than I remember seeing him in previous days. #Bears, Bears,-0.16666666666666666, 2019-08-05 19:18:32
 4. Eddie Jackson will be deployed in press man coverage often in Pagano’s defense and I think he could be a weapon there. He broke up a perfectly thrown ball to A-Rob in the back of the end zone showing physicality that I don’t know if I’ve seen before from him. #Bears, Bears,0.5, 2019-08-05 19:18:33
 5. Adam Shaheen looked lost. He got his fair share of reps with the first team O and was deployed in the slot and out wide but he dropped a couple and didn’t make the most of his opportunity. Confidence in him dropping every day. #Bears, Bears,0.3375, 2019-08-05 19:18:33
 6. Wims Marvin Hall could be considered roster locks at this point. #Bears, Bears,0.0, 2019-08-05 19:18:33
 7. Another day another dominant performance from Khalil Mack. He didn’t even play that much but he made his presence felt. The entire front was excellent vs run which is nothing new.That’s all I got. Again lotta encouraging signs today. #Bears, Bears,0.3340909090909091, 2019-08-05 19:18:34

 Luke: A solid day for Lamar Jackson who completed mostly shorter passes in full-team periods. Joe Callahan threw a bomb to Jaylen Smith for a touchdown late in practice.

 It’s an intriguing move to say the least as the #Jets seem to have their starters at guard in Kelechi Osemele and Brian Winters. Depth in the trenches is never a bad thing.

 Wouldn’t surprise me to see #Falcons keep 4 RBs to start season but as injuries occur over course of year I think a 4th RB likely becomes expendable since I doubt the Falcons dress more than 3 on gameday. So you’d need an injury to Freeman or Smith to justify keeping RB4, Falcons,0.25, 2019-08-05 20:21:38

 The lowest number of completions during any given season for Andy Dalton is 226 (2018). So it's more than likely that Dalton will become the #Bengals all-time leader in completions this season (he just needs 211 to surpass Ken Anderson who has 2654)., Bengals,0.25, 2019-08-05 21:39:55
 @PTTF_Eli @MatthewBerryTMR @FieldYates @Stephania_ESPN @MikeClayNFL Hardly a muddled backfield. If anything this locks down Mack as their go-to guy.

 The fan base seems unified in believing this will be a playoff team or at least a team that competes for a playoff spot. When was the last time the fan base was this confident in August? I’d say 2010. Maybe 2011. Great to see again/ feel for myself real positivity/hope. #Jets, Jets,-0.057142857142857155, 2019-08-05 21:57:25

 @KSIXI Try to get 1 thing right. Asafo-Adjei was a 7th round pick. They picked him to start at RT next year. He might even start by the end of this year; which is why they only gave Remmers a 1 year deal. He has a concussion. Making calls like this 1 wk into camp is absurd #NYGiants, NYGiants,-0.08285714285714287, 2019-08-05 21:57:29

 Won’t lie I don’t understand how some fans can be purely negative about the #Bears right now. Very select few but still shocking that in a year where most expect them to compete for a SB you have a few that expect them to win 7-8 games &amp; it’s like they want it to happen., Bears,0.010714285714285732, 2019-08-05 23:49:29

 Random thoughts: I really like the idea of Chester Rogers as our WR 5. He hasn’t always been great but he made some plays for us last year as our WR 2. I hope we can keep Fountain on the practice squad. I like his upside.No way Pascal clears waivers if he’s cut #Colts, Colts,0.125, 2019-08-06 01:24:30

All 3 will demand pricey contract extensions and it will mess up the salary cap if they signed with hefty contracts.

 In a game this is a 5-yard loss (or perhaps a forced fumble) by LEFT EDGE @Fire_Burns99. Van Roten pulls to manage 53's pursuit. Gotta move faster than that 73. Burns will wreck games this year. I'm convinced. It shows up on tape. #Panthers https://t.co/VatUX5i4Ad, Panthers,-0.23333333333333336, 2019-08-06 04:55:17

 When he retired he was the all time leader in Playoff Receptions &amp; Rec Yards (still 4th in yards). Was he fast???  In SB 18 at age 35 he blows past a rookie 23 year old CB by the name of Darrell Green for a 50 yard bomb... caught a TD from Plunkett 2 plays later., ,-0.03, 2019-08-06 04:55:29

 @MarkBuran2 Born and raised in Seattle. English teacher in high school told class to do a report on anyone living or who once lived. Did mine on Vince Lombardi.
