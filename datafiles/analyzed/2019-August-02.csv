 But are they willing to make him the highest paid WR from a Total APY standpoint? Even if Julio slightly passes OBJ w/ a Total APY of 16.5M/yr; it would yield a New Money APY of 22.5M/yr on a 2yr extension.

 One of the reasons #Bears offense will have an easier time executing during the regular season than they have in camp is because opposing defenses will be more predictable per Matt Nagy.

 Beane on OBL says Tommy Sweeney has been very consistent even with the ones and that the stage hasn’t been too big for him despite where he was drafted. Pretty high praise for a seventh rounder... #Bills, Bills,0.18375, 2019-08-02 18:17:22

 Washington's leading rusher last year was AP - He's old and not much help as a WR. Gio to Washington makes ALOT of sense.  I'm all for it. We have way more RB's than OT's. #bengals #trentwilliams #gio #newdey, bengals trentwilliams gio newdey,0.125, 2019-08-02 18:17:36
 #49ersCamp Notes: Jason Verrett was matched up against Marquise Goodwin during team drills. Goodwin ran a solid comeback route but Verrett stuck to him diving to swat away Jimmy Garoppolo’s pass. The defense erupted on the sideline. A great moment for Verrett. #49ers, 49ersCamp 49ers,0.4, 2019-08-02 18:17:36

 Mentioned this the other day: George Fant is a good 1-on-1 pass blocker at OT especially for being a college hoops player. Today twice stymies Rasheed Green in pass-rush drill. 2d time Fant’s punch to chest plate pushes the rushing Green back 2 steps. #Seahawks, Seahawks,0.029166666666666657, 2019-08-02 18:17:39

 Wrote about Fran Tarkenton this week. 1 of his receivers John Gilliam is really underrated. In 3 yrs w/ STL Gilliam averaged 46 rec 929 yd (best in NFL) and 6.3 TD then 41 rec 824 yd (best again) and 6.8 TD with MIN.

 @KFANRosen great coaches don't want complacency/players feeling secure in their jobs. Ask Ty Law &amp; Drew Bledsoe under Belichick.Any player playing under Scotty Bowman or Mike Keenan. To reach greatness you need powerful self motivation or fear of lose. #Vikings seem to lack both, Vikings,0.5000000000000001, 2019-08-02 19:09:27

 Sorry for the delay on this. I came down with a blinding headache on the way home from #Bears camp and needed some time to rest. Here are some of my thoughts from what I saw in Bourbonnais., Bears,-0.3277777777777778, 2019-08-02 20:07:12
 People are picking on Mitch Trubisky a lot for not being sharp enough with his throw. I am here to say it's not all on him. Receivers had a bad tendency to drop passes run poor routes and not look for the ball quick enough to make a play on it.  #Bears, Bears,-0.1486111111111111, 2019-08-02 20:07:13
 That said I can say this with total confidence. Trubisky and Allen Robinson are completely on the same page. I don't think they missed a single connection all morning. Every pass Mitch threw him was on target and caught. That duo is going to produce.  #Bears, Bears,0.007142857142857145, 2019-08-02 20:07:13
 As for Trubisky himself? He still has that tendency to get lazy with his fundamentals particularly when under pressure or throwing it deep. He's excellent at the short-to-intermediate range but forgets his feet sometimes in those situations. Still something to work on. #Bears, Bears,0.18333333333333332, 2019-08-02 20:07:13
 Javon Wims has not taken his foot off the gas in practice. Though he didn't make a lot of catches that was because the QBs weren't throwing it to him. He was open quite a bit. Though known mostly for his size he's actually faster than he looks. #Bears, Bears,0.16666666666666666, 2019-08-02 20:07:13
 The #Bears running backs are so much more dangerous in the passing game now. Tarik Cohen is obviously a threat but both David Montgomery and Mike Davis had nice plays in pass-catching drills. That dimension of the offense is about to pop wide open., Bears,0.075, 2019-08-02 20:07:14
 Adam Shaheen returned for practice but was limited in reps probably to be careful with his back issue. He did have a nice play in red zone drills with a TD over Deon Bush. Still the tight ends did not make any significant impact plays especially with Trey Burton out.  #Bears, Bears,0.078125, 2019-08-02 20:07:14
 Khalil Mack makes it look way too easy. Every time he stepped on the field for a rep he created havoc. Bobby Massie had a nightmare blocking him. On one play Mack got into the backfield so fast that Chase Daniel basically just gave up and ate the sack. Beast.  #Bears, Bears,0.31666666666666665, 2019-08-02 20:07:14
 The surprise player who stood out to me was Joel Iyiegbuniwe. The second-year ILB is bigger now and hasn't lost any of his speed and quickness. Running backs could not block him in pass protection drills. Danny Trevathan is still the clear cut starter but Iggy is rising. #Bears, Bears,0.03333333333333334, 2019-08-02 20:07:14
 Throwing against that #Bears secondary is going to be torture for quarterbacks. Kyle Fuller and Prince Amukamara were all over WRs in drills creating turnovers. Eddie Jackson was on the prowl and Ha Ha Clinton-Dix had his first INT of camp. Everywhere you throw is ill-advised., Bears,-0.18333333333333335, 2019-08-02 20:07:15
 Elliott Fry responded to Eddy Pineiro's strong Thursday practice with a near-flawless Friday. Both #Bears kickers have looked more than capable of being the starter on this team. Their battle will likely be decided in live game action during the preseason., Bears,0.22996632996632999, 2019-08-02 20:07:15

 If I had to draft someone from the #49ers backfield it’s Breida. Tevin Coleman is NOT a 3-down back and McKinnon is still not 100%.Breida played through tons of injuries in 2018 and still was RB23.  His 2019 ADP is RB57 (13.10 overall). He's the value play.#FantasyFootball, 49ers FantasyFootball,0.025925925925925932, 2019-08-02 20:36:11

 I can't imagine Beane isn't looking for a quality back up center right now. Will Morse make it a full season. From what his past shows I say no.

 I like the signing. Position is very deep this year. Jenkins McLeod Sendejo and Cyprien with countess as the 5th S But mostly for special teams. Yes I think all 5 safeties make the team I don’t think they want Jenkins playing 100% of the snaps again, ,0.28571428571428575, 2019-08-02 21:47:11

 I find this to be pretty consistent with his tape. You can hate on Bell all you want but Conner definitely picked up on Bell’s patient running style. He was great in working of his blockers especially pullers and allowing them to get set up last season., ,0.07142857142857142, 2019-08-03 01:01:00

 Good stuff for Chuks. He was pretty raw coming all things considered but did have great feet and tools. Refine that and the Steelers have a future cornerstone this line.

 Call me crazy I think there’s a possibility Brian Gutekunst could trade Bryan Bulaga. The practice he sat out and even now I think Matt LaFleur has some concerns about him getting out in space on certain run plays.

 Offense doesn’t look all that behind as the beat has been reporting in live play situations. What’s more accurate from my POV is the defensive front seems to be ahead of the offensive line. Defense would’ve had hecka sacks if this was a game. Your thoughts? #Packers, Packers,0.047272727272727286, 2019-08-03 02:09:55

 If this alleged offer from Washington is true; it really speaks to the competitor that he is.  They played 4 QBs. One that hadn't played a game in 3-4 years.  He likely would have had found playing time. I guess he wants a safe spot on the bench behind Russell with minimal PT., ,0.027777777777777776, 2019-08-03 02:22:49
