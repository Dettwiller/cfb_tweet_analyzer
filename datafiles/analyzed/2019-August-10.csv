 Josh Dobbs is thoroughly unconvincing as a passing QB. He drops back a long way and his decision making is sporadic.

 Not great. I still have hope for Jones but being torched by nobody’s wasn’t a great look. If either of the top 3 CB’s go down as of now we’re in trouble.

 As you suggest however it's likely 1 or 2 will emerge to play more (54 56 the most likely IMO) while 1 will either go to IR or not make the team.  If 5 guys remain healthy through the season Martindale is a master snap distributor and no one may play 500. #RavensFlock, RavensFlock,0.3, 2019-08-10 10:27:09

 @CharlietheFFCat The @Ravens made the first half all about Miles Boykin on Thursday.  As of now he's the player I'd expect to have the most catches with the uncertainty of Marquise Brown's return.

 This play showed more to me than just an off-target throw. It exemplified him not making any reads post-snap. Not unexpected but he consistently locked on to his first read in the 2nd quarter. Showed a little better in the 3rd which was encouraging. https://t.co/hWuV9ZGasb, ,0.1578125, 2019-08-10 12:25:17

 @kspice2803 @packers No idea but also don't know how many season ticket holders especially older ones attend a given game. Might also be fans attending games turn over a lot more and so aren't as likely to behave in the same way as long-time attendees.

 @RobDemovsky Poor guy. He must have been drafted from Vanderbilt  to take over running the D if #Packers don't pay for BM50. Looks like first 2 seasons injured leaving a bunch of less capable but similar standard LBs.

 My best guess on this one is that Sam Darnold read Cover 1 all the way.

 Couple more pointers I seen from #HOUvsGB game..1.) KeKe played like crap.2.) Johnnie Dixon should make this roster &amp; be a solid WR 4 or 5 on this team.  3.)
