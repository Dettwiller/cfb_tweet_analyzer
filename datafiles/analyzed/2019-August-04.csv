 With a good defense we can be competitive in every game. Vikings with Keenum were 13-3 largely thanks to their aggressive defense! Make opponent work for every yard and keep 3rd down conversion success rate low! Last year we got killed on 3rd downs in important situations, ,0.07676767676767676, 2019-08-04 12:29:50

 Both got better it‚Äôs not really a head scratcher to make the case either way. Different strategies Jets went fewer high priced Bills went more players and depth. If we‚Äôre including draft picks too I‚Äôd say the edge goes more to Buffalo tho., ,0.26, 2019-08-04 13:59:47

 So when you see Russell Wilson at 20% Frank Clark at 10% and Earl Thomas at 8% this is the accurate representation of their positional values as top players in the game. You can plug the total cap into the equation and it equals dollar value of the contract. #Seahawks #GoHawks, Seahawks GoHawks,0.12500000000000003, 2019-08-04 16:23:42

 Colts floor for this season has to be 11-5 and I'd say their ceiling is likely 14-2. Which would mean they'd have to win either at KC/Pitt/NO. The easiest of those 3 games should be at Pitt.

 Signing mid level talent doesn't always work. Sometimes you have  pay up 2 get better. I love @BuffaloBills but you can't just spend all the money on  mid level players &amp; expect good results.Signing all those OL has so far proven that.

 Paul Richardson vs. Jimmie Moreland Richardson runs slant but doesn't get a ton of room. Moreland with a small grab. Richardson is able to shield him. Nice effort by Moreland to try and knock the ball away after catch. Small things. #Redskins https://t.co/aVoWLJmzQW, Redskins,0.15, 2019-08-04 23:10:09

 FADE! Kelvin Harmon vs Josh Norman Dwayne Haskins throws a nice fade ball. Josh Norman has good coverage and gets a hand up but Harmon is too strong plucking it out of the air. Beautiful.

 Jordy Nelson never got enough credit for the sports media. He easily is a top 5 most underrated receiver of all time. He could do everything. The Rodgers to Nelson back shoulder throw was and still is the best connection in NFL history., ,0.4, 2019-08-05 02:21:51
 Not sure what to make of this. Fairly good coverage by safeties Cockrell and Jones. Seems like Olsen either lost track of the ball may have run out of real estate on the back line or just couldn't adjust his body in time with two DB's on top of him.

 You make the call: DPI or a clean PBU? I think it's a great play by 56 Carter on Moore who has stood out this camp with sneaky-good coverage skills. Back is turned but it does not appear that he interfered. Also a good look at the line play. #Panthers https://t.co/FkLZR5dcg8, Panthers,0.5133333333333333, 2019-08-05 02:29:46

 To further my point for @Iam_jerryhughes to be a 99 with a #Fearmonger #XFactor in @EAMaddenNFL for #NFL100...in 2018 no one had more pressures in the league coming from the right side then #55.69 Total Pressures.
