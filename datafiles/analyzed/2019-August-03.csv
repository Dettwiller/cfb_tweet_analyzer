 Aaron Rodgers was actually looking like Aaron Rodgers out there tonight throwing dimes to Kumerow and Tae including a sharp throw for Tae in the EZ under coverage of Jaire in the 1-on-1 drills early on. #Packers, Packers,-0.008333333333333331, 2019-08-03 07:08:53
 Couldn't tell if the RBs are any good bc our top two RBs were both out with hamstring issues but Carson (I think?) had a real nice jump cut on one of his runs got to the next level. #Packers, Packers,0.5249999999999999, 2019-08-03 07:08:54
 Tae Whitewater Jake and fast Trevor Davis were the standouts at receiver tonight. All three made fantastic plays. Tae is next-level. #Packers, Packers,0.20000000000000004, 2019-08-03 07:08:54
 Big Bob Tonyan had a catch in the Move the Ball drill that I thought was good. I'm not sold on this TE group but we'll see what they do this August. #Packers, Packers,0.35, 2019-08-03 07:08:54
 In the trenches we got a little bit of the big battle of training camp ‚Äî David Bakhtiari vs Za'Darius Smith. Bakhtiari is for my money the best LT in football and Z Smith has won a few 1-on-1s vs him with great power and speed. #Packers, Packers,0.28250000000000003, 2019-08-03 07:08:54

 Mason Crosby was out with his calf injury and in his place Kickin' Ficken had a mixed night missing FGs in team drills but then making 5/6 kicking drill kicks including a 63-yarder. #Packers, Packers,-0.1, 2019-08-03 07:08:55
 Overall things seem to be going in a good direction. Offense needs work but that's not surprising in a whole new system. Defense looks strong üí™ and ST is ST I guess. #Packers, Packers,0.1866161616161616, 2019-08-03 07:08:55

 I'm a #BuffaloBills fan. But when my g/f asked me what I think their record will be I said 5-11 b/c they need a much better offensive line. The team has talent and an up and coming QB but without a good o-line a good rusher and QB will look okay at best., BuffaloBills,0.6799999999999999, 2019-08-03 09:20:41

 @WhoDey_UK I think we're all desperate for a good season. I'll even settle for not getting wins as long as we are competitive and everything looks like it has a plan and we're moving forward as a team. Might be a bit of short term pain for long term gain. I'm OK with that. #WhoDey, WhoDey,0.1142857142857143, 2019-08-03 11:53:31

 Joe Walker is an interesting player. Former QB turned WR. 670 rec YDS 4 TDs in his 1st year (2018) as a wideout. 6-3/210. Similar to Cam Meredith.

 Another angle of the play reveals savvy work by Norman big nickel Jones and Boston. 24 actually hands off his assignment 33 baiting Ryan into a throw to the corner a spot 33 clearly anticipated.

 WR: Kenny Golladay is a great talent but playing in a run-heavy offense limits his upside. This offense will likely only support one fantasy-relevant receiver due to its run-heavy nature. This makes Marvin Jones Jr. a player to avoid.#Lions#FantasyFootball, Lions FantasyFootball,0.09642857142857143, 2019-08-03 18:46:09

 If I‚Äôm the #Raiders I‚Äôd inquire about Clowney. Why not?I wouldn‚Äôt give up a major haul for him but he‚Äôs undoubtedly an upgrade from what they have now. They‚Äôd have to pay him sooner than later though. After the AB deal Mayock has earned trust if something goes down., Raiders,-0.03101851851851853, 2019-08-03 19:01:49

 Jalen Hurd was impressive during 1-on-1 drills today as well. He did a good job of using his frame to box out or outmuscle defenders for the ball. Hurd seemed excited about the role of being a weapon in the red zone. He certainly has the frame (6-5 225) to do it. #49ers, 49ers,0.4578571428571429, 2019-08-03 22:20:20

 He stopped and did not meet the backer at the point of contact. His arms are outside of the defenders at the point of contact. He never reset his arms to get inside leverage on the defender. He does not have a solid base which caused him to lean and be off balance., ,-0.26666666666666666, 2019-08-03 22:21:17

 Here is a route concept I'm excepting to see more of from the #Saints this year.The magic of Colston/Graham together made for a potent threat of two big athletic bodies with nice hands on two sides of the field.

 One thing that I'm keeping an eye on with the #Falcons is the TE play. I believe Koetter is going to feature the RB's as receivers more but I'm looking at the TE's. Their ability to execute blocks and be featured as receivers will determine what personnel packages can be featured, Falcons,0.5, 2019-08-04 02:44:40

 That‚Äôs the advantage Of running with the QB. That is you‚Äôre gonna have just as many blockers as there are defenders. I love what Jim Harbaugh is doing with the L. Jackson! If they succeed the NFL will never be the same at the qb position. And neither defenses. Paradigm shift., ,0.3333333333333333, 2019-08-04 04:00:24

 @CarliLloyd hey! I got my gf tickets to the USWNT game at the Linc on August 29th. She loves you and has always looked up to you. Would you be willing to sign her autograph exclusively at some point that evening? I‚Äôve converted her from a Giants to an Eagles fan! #FlyEaglesFly, FlyEaglesFly,-0.07500000000000001, 2019-08-04 04:56:56
