Thomas Roper, Josh Dobbs is thoroughly unconvincing as a passing QB. He drops back a long way and his decision making is sporadic. Compare with Mason Rudolph who's more composed footwork is better and dropped a nice back shoulder throw for the TD to Washington. #Steelers, Steelers, 2019-08-10 06:50:14

Ken McKusick, As you suggest however it's likely 1 or 2 will emerge to play more (54 56 the most likely IMO) while 1 will either go to IR or not make the team.  If 5 guys remain healthy through the season Martindale is a master snap distributor and no one may play 500. #RavensFlock, RavensFlock, 2019-08-10 10:27:09

Ken McKusick, @TomDegenerate Someone should emerge naturally from the @Ravens edge players. Probably Williams Bowser or Ferguson.  Any 1 of those could take a larger role.

Elo H, I remember Eli's rookie preseason debut for #NYG.  They played vs. the Chiefs.  His 1st play fans erupted as he put a pass in the WR's gut but the WR dropped it.  2nd play he handed the ball off to Ron Dayne who took it to the house for like 70 yards. lol, NYG, 2019-08-10 12:31:02
Marc Saulino, AB is simply Awesome RB holdout in Dallas does #NYG have any worthwhile WR with Shepard on the shelf Gordon holding out... great opportunity to get your hands on some quality information.

Hayden Curry, Thoughts on #Bucs preseason: Jameis Winston looked liked a different QB on that first possession completely letting the game come to him. PB RoJo and Ellington could be a nice trio at RB. I'm slightly intrigued and hear my out by carrying 2 kickers. One a driver one a wedge, Bucs, 2019-08-10 12:46:05

RichRymanPG, @kspice2803 @packers No idea but also don't know how many season ticket holders especially older ones attend a given game.

Ryan, Even if AB retires today the Cooper trade was still an excellent one for #Raiders1st round pick for a player who for whatever reason rarely performed in Silver and Black.

🏈Adam Aniba🏈, @KyleColsch @realBenEsherick @dh_simba7 “It don’t mean he has to as well”? Again this offense is based on anticipation throws. When a WR misses an assignment/gets pushed of his route ints happen.

Anthony Rivardo, The whole point of why it was an excellent throw is that he threw it with great timing where the ball was out of his hands as the receiver was making his break so when the ball got there the DB’s head still wouldn’t be turned around.

BMcD_Sports, This means you shouldn’t play GOAT Bortles. Brandon Allen might be the guy who gets the most snaps at QB tonight. Last year his best preseason performance came in week 1 when he finished 10/15 73 yards 1 TD. He failed to score or surpass 70 yards in the other 3 games. 🤔 #DFS, DFS, 2019-08-10 17:43:10

Kareem Copeland, Haskins INT in 7 on 7 to Harris but comes back with a strike to the sideline to McLaurin. And next snap throws another INT to McIntosh. I think that’s three picks for him today. #redskins, redskins, 2019-08-10 18:54:19

Brice Christianson, Kizer started &amp; had 29 snaps to Boyle’s 16 snaps making me think that the #Packers want to develop Kizer more.

Travis May, Not much positive to talk about on offense. Corey had a couple drops on fastballs from Mariota. Delanie and Firkser both dropped TDs.

"Tree" of the Cannon Balls Podcast, Here's a shorter version of the Bruce Arains offense breakdown. We had a little taste of the BA Offense in the 1st preseason game. Winston's 1st drive was textbook BA offense quick passes shifts with a shot or two deep. Get to know how it's done. #Bucshttps://t.co/0aQA862Dvg, Bucs, 2019-08-10 21:17:02

Louis Riddick, Antonio Brown &amp;  #Raiders are the hot item so I’ll offer my thoughts: 1) I’m hearing the “going dark” and “radio silence” stuff being put out there is bs. 2) His wanting to wear his old helmet is dumb. The studies in helmet safety/technology prove that. 3) I bet he plays in 2019, Raiders, 2019-08-10 21:39:11

MeRk, Good thread...for those of us who were hoping to put him on the PS for a red shirt year that just became vastly more risky/difficult. Anytime a rookie shows even an ounce of pass rush ability front offices take note. With his measurables Someone thin at DL will claim him #Bills, Bills, 2019-08-10 22:31:39
Scott Casten, Any injury is tough especially in the preseason or at training camp but Oren Burks is not a big loss and shouldn’t have been your starting ILB anyway @packers Just no depth and have to go sign or trade for someone. Defense will be improved #GoPackGo, GoPackGo, 2019-08-10 22:31:44
