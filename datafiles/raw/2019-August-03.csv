Dritewater Crake, Just a few quick thoughts about tonight's #FamilyNight practice and the upcoming preseason. (thread) #Packers, FamilyNight Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:53
Dritewater Crake, Aaron Rodgers was actually looking like Aaron Rodgers out there tonight throwing dimes to Kumerow and Tae including a sharp throw for Tae in the EZ under coverage of Jaire in the 1-on-1 drills early on. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:53
Dritewater Crake, Couldn't tell if the RBs are any good bc our top two RBs were both out with hamstring issues but Carson (I think?) had a real nice jump cut on one of his runs got to the next level. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:54
Dritewater Crake, Tae Whitewater Jake and fast Trevor Davis were the standouts at receiver tonight. All three made fantastic plays. Tae is next-level. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:54
Dritewater Crake, Big Bob Tonyan had a catch in the Move the Ball drill that I thought was good. I'm not sold on this TE group but we'll see what they do this August. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:54
Dritewater Crake, In the trenches we got a little bit of the big battle of training camp ‚Äî David Bakhtiari vs Za'Darius Smith. Bakhtiari is for my money the best LT in football and Z Smith has won a few 1-on-1s vs him with great power and speed. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:54
Dritewater Crake, We're seeing what Mike Pettine D will really look like in Green Bay with a year under the belt and the system in place. And it looks good. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:55
Dritewater Crake, Mason Crosby was out with his calf injury and in his place Kickin' Ficken had a mixed night missing FGs in team drills but then making 5/6 kicking drill kicks including a 63-yarder. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:55
Dritewater Crake, Overall things seem to be going in a good direction. Offense needs work but that's not surprising in a whole new system. Defense looks strong üí™ and ST is ST I guess. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:55
Dritewater Crake, First preseason game is next Thursday night at 7:00 vs Houston. We'll get a better idea of what things look like then when every play doesn't go for an uncontested scoooore haha. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 07:08:55

Biancoverde, @WhoDey_UK I think we're all desperate for a good season. I'll even settle for not getting wins as long as we are competitive and everything looks like it has a plan and we're moving forward as a team. Might be a bit of short term pain for long term gain. I'm OK with that. #WhoDey, WhoDey, 2019-08-03 11:53:31

ESNY, Teams started first-team offense against second-team defense. Shepherd beat his man and dropped Le‚ÄôVeon for a loss on the first play a coverage sack came next but since then Sam Darnold has been pretty good fitting it in tight windows. #Jets, Jets, 2019-08-03 15:57:52
John Ellis, Boston had a knack for making big plays in huge moments in the passing game. 2014 NFC South Title Game (week 17) 33 fielded a Matt Ryan pick. The play illustrates his elite timing speed and acceleration great assets for a deep safety. #Panthers https://t.co/TS4ZYZSWn9, Panthers, 2019-08-03 15:58:00

John Ellis, Another angle of the play reveals savvy work by Norman big nickel Jones and Boston. 24 actually hands off his assignment 33 baiting Ryan into a throw to the corner a spot 33 clearly anticipated. It takes a great deal of acceleration and timing to pull this off. #Panthers https://t.co/cSxSLGnmlH, Panthers, 2019-08-03 15:58:17

Michael Caro, @schadjoe I‚Äôll reply to this one too. There shouldn‚Äôt be a competition. Rosen needs to start week 1 or we wasted draft picks. He‚Äôs either the answer or he‚Äôs not and we move on in 2020. We don‚Äôt need to eke out a few Fitz wins for another mediocre season and no answer on QB future. #FinsUp, FinsUp, 2019-08-03 18:10:49

Thank you for the trades, MLB teams, The part about Trubisky now underthrowing deep balls seems to me like maybe he's trying to compensate for Miller being a terrible deep ball route runner last year. So many of those "overthrows" were just Miller slowing down instead of running through the ball., , 2019-08-03 23:02:08
