NNK SkinsFan, The #Redskins QB rotation seems obvious for first game. Make sure Colt is ready and physically able. Then Keenum as he's picking up the O. Then Haskins to watch the other 2.

Kennedy Paynter, Gruden pissed bc of holding on the OL. Haskins fumbles snap at the 30 with 10 seconds left. Time out. FG unit comes out. Haskins frustrated. Showed more poise calling plays and stepping up in the pocket marrying his feet to his eyes. He is improving. #Redskins #RedskinsTweetTeam, Redskins RedskinsTweetTeam, 2019-08-05 15:40:51

Bernd Buchmasser, Brady hitting free agency would be absolutely insane and there's a part in me that wants to see what happens.That being said unless he completely falls off the cliff this year ‚Äì unlikely given his track record ‚Äì there is no chance he plays elsewhere than New England in 2020., , 2019-08-05 18:46:30
Evan Valenti, Just some creative language here. Brady will get paid as a free agent every year here on out which means he could end up making more than those tags. Franchise tag and transition tags for 2019 QB's $24.8 million and $22.8 million respectively, , 2019-08-05 18:46:32

Jack Soble, I also thought Pagano threw some exotic blitzes at the O that for the most part the OL handled well and 10 handled them really well.Was the pace great?

Jack Soble, Takeaways from today‚Äôs #BearsCamp:1. This was Trubisky‚Äôs best day. He was consistently on the money - not just throwing catchable balls (one of @PFF‚Äôs biggest gripes) but hitting guys in stride putting the ball exactly where it needs to be. #Bears, BearsCamp Bears, 2019-08-05 19:18:31
Jack Soble, 2. His velocity and timing were also excellent. I used the word ‚Äúdart‚Äù more than once today because that‚Äôs what he was throwing. The one thing missing: deep balls. He hit downfield passes but very few (if any) 9 routes. Something to watch for tomorrow. #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-05 19:18:32
Jack Soble, 3. Buster Skrine mighta been the star of the show on defense. He was flying around out there getting to and tipping footballs faster than I remember seeing him in previous days. #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-05 19:18:32
Jack Soble, 4. Eddie Jackson will be deployed in press man coverage often in Pagano‚Äôs defense and I think he could be a weapon there. He broke up a perfectly thrown ball to A-Rob in the back of the end zone showing physicality that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve seen before from him. #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-05 19:18:33
Jack Soble, 5. Adam Shaheen looked lost. He got his fair share of reps with the first team O and was deployed in the slot and out wide but he dropped a couple and didn‚Äôt make the most of his opportunity. Confidence in him dropping every day. #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-05 19:18:33
Jack Soble, 6. Wims Marvin Hall could be considered roster locks at this point. #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-05 19:18:33
Jack Soble, 7. Another day another dominant performance from Khalil Mack. He didn‚Äôt even play that much but he made his presence felt. The entire front was excellent vs run which is nothing new.That‚Äôs all I got. Again lotta encouraging signs today. #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-05 19:18:34

WNST, Luke: A solid day for Lamar Jackson who completed mostly shorter passes in full-team periods. Joe Callahan threw a bomb to Jaylen Smith for a touchdown late in practice.

Aaron Freeman, Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me to see #Falcons keep 4 RBs to start season but as injuries occur over course of year I think a 4th RB likely becomes expendable since I doubt the Falcons dress more than 3 on gameday. So you‚Äôd need an injury to Freeman or Smith to justify keeping RB4, Falcons, 2019-08-05 20:21:38

Josh Kirkendall, The lowest number of completions during any given season for Andy Dalton is 226 (2018). So it's more than likely that Dalton will become the #Bengals all-time leader in completions this season (he just needs 211 to surpass Ken Anderson who has 2654)., Bengals, 2019-08-05 21:39:55
Kyle Purdue, @PTTF_Eli @MatthewBerryTMR @FieldYates @Stephania_ESPN @MikeClayNFL Hardly a muddled backfield. If anything this locks down Mack as their go-to guy.

Travis Wingfield, This shot in the ‚Äúturkey hole‚Äù is something the requires a certain type of arm.

Pinstripe-Blue, @KSIXI Try to get 1 thing right. Asafo-Adjei was a 7th round pick. They picked him to start at RT next year. He might even start by the end of this year; which is why they only gave Remmers a 1 year deal. He has a concussion.

Heath Allen Hanchey, When he retired he was the all time leader in Playoff Receptions &amp; Rec Yards (still 4th in yards). Was he fast???  In SB 18 at age 35 he blows past a rookie 23 year old CB by the name of Darrell Green for a 50 yard bomb... caught a TD from Plunkett 2 plays later., , 2019-08-06 04:55:29

Lunchbox, @MarkBuran2 Born and raised in Seattle. English teacher in high school told class to do a report on anyone living or who once lived. Did mine on Vince Lombardi.
