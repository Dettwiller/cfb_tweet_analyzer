Logi B 513, @AnalyticRedsFan @BigRedTweeter Every single quarterback misses throws. Especially in training camp when you’re throwing to a lot of different receivers because you’re number one and number three receiver are not on the field.You trash Dalton’s accuracy but ignore the analytics.https://t.co/hXdPU4gvob, , 2019-08-04 15:22:41

Robert Schmitz, I’m right on the line between “encouraged” and “indifferent”. I’m anxious for Mitch to be “great” but he looked like a flawed-but-capable QB from what I saw at camp. Add that players say their “camp mistakes” come from trying new things and I think it’s time we wait for Week 1., , 2019-08-04 16:10:00

The Real Fordy, So when you see Russell Wilson at 20% Frank Clark at 10% and Earl Thomas at 8% this is the accurate representation of their positional values as top players in the game.

The Real Fordy, Why exactly? Because you're not spending todays money. UR projecting your future budget. So 1 year into a deal signed in 2020 that $25M APY begins to look a lot like the 10% of cap designated in any year for a top positional player. The winners get a jump on future cap #Seahawks, Seahawks, 2019-08-04 16:30:20

Adam Clanton, @jmmcgee_7 @HoustonRockets @astros @HoustonTexans @SportsTalk790 Depleted = losing Kevin Durant when you’d tied the series at 2-2 with him playing. Then that same team still had the core three players of a 73-win team on the floor. I’m not saying they didn’t fail; but comparing what #Texans have done or not done as an organization to that??, Texans, 2019-08-04 16:36:29

Adam Clanton, @DrDeadass_B @htownrocketsgal ....beeeeeeecause those teams had general managers making moves to try and win games. The #Texans needed a left tackle (and others) to protect their franchise quarterback. So they drafted a project and then fired the GM a few weeks later. And they’ll just go ahead a not have one., Texans, 2019-08-04 22:50:37

Daniel Gallen, there was one large spider doing work on an insane web in front of my seat in the press box. now there are two. also Carson Wentz just chucked a bomb to DeSean Jackson. #Eagles, Eagles, 2019-08-05 00:28:54
Eliot Shorr-Parks, Wentz rolls out and launches it about 50 yards down the field to DeSean Jackson who jumps up and catches it. #Eagles, Eagles, 2019-08-05 00:28:54
Eric Fenstermaker, One thing I noticed early in the #Eagles open practice: the Eagles offense has great camaraderie. Wentz Howard Ertz Jackson and Agholor are all joking and talking a lot. Great communication will be key for this offense. #FlyEaglesFly, Eagles FlyEaglesFly, 2019-08-05 00:28:55

Complementary Football, 10 sacks isnt likely but it also isnt impossible. Part of Mack's issue was lack of opportunity. If this offense is successful ferrel could get 10. But it's highly unlikely. If he got 8 I'd be super impressed. #raiders, raiders, 2019-08-05 01:01:06

Steve, I think there's team issues and not necessarily individual concerns. Redzone numbers have to be way better and the defense can never have a season like last years again. Biggest question mark for the team is QB #49ers, 49ers, 2019-08-05 02:17:19

Taylor Fahrenkrug, Jordy Nelson never got enough credit for the sports media. He easily is a top 5 most underrated receiver of all time. He could do everything. The Rodgers to Nelson back shoulder throw was and still is the best connection in NFL history., , 2019-08-05 02:21:51
John Ellis, Not sure what to make of this. Fairly good coverage by safeties Cockrell and Jones. Seems like Olsen either lost track of the ball may have run out of real estate on the back line or just couldn't adjust his body in time with two DB's on top of him. Nice spiral tho. #Panthers https://t.co/eUBzHtE597, Panthers, 2019-08-05 02:21:56

John Ellis, Never like speculating. I will say: Newton was off today. Intermediate throws were typically high or behind his target. DJ Moore as we discussed drops almost nothing. Once again we see Moore's growth as an intermediate threat. Superb hands and body control. #Panthers https://t.co/LIF15nvxTx, Panthers, 2019-08-05 03:17:39

rb1machine, 👀This is definitely worth watching. FWIW since the 2000 #NFL season in half-point #PPR leagues no team has had more #RB1s than the @Chiefs (8; 2001-2003; 2005-2006 2010 2013 2017).

John Ellis, Speaking of line play: look at Matsko's maulers. That hole is a mile wide thanks largely to 60 Williams and 61 Paradis.
