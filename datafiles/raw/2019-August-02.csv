Vincent Modrak, @nessa8132 He’s had an unlucky stretch to begin his career. I’ll give him this season to prove healthy or not before labeling him. If he’s playing he’s an absolute monster.

Tom Brady is Satan 👿, I had a dream last night that I was watching some sports show on TV and the Jets were 5-1. The commentator said “I can’t believe it but we can actually start talking about the Jets realistically winning 11 or 12 games this year”. One of those strange very realistic dreams 🤔, , 2019-08-02 14:39:19

Aaron Leming, Based on reports: Each kicker (Pineiro &amp; Fry) have had 3 kicking sessions. They've each matched the other's lack of misses (121).Pretty incredible turnaround considering how bad the "competition" had been up until camp.

Brian McFarland, I wouldn’t have thought this was much of a possibility - the Ravens gave Bethel a 2-yr deal for a reason - but the Trawick signing has to make you wonder. Cutting Bethel creates $1.5M in Cap space w/ $500K in Dead $ on both the ‘19 &amp; ‘20 Caps. And recoups that 5th Rd Comp pick., , 2019-08-02 18:07:26

Rob Lowder, #49ersCamp Notes: Jason Verrett was matched up against Marquise Goodwin during team drills.

Gregg Bell, Mentioned this the other day: George Fant is a good 1-on-1 pass blocker at OT especially for being a college hoops player. Today twice stymies Rasheed Green in pass-rush drill. 2d time Fant’s punch to chest plate pushes the rushing Green back 2 steps. #Seahawks, Seahawks, 2019-08-02 18:17:39

Erik Lambert, Sorry for the delay on this. I came down with a blinding headache on the way home from #Bears camp and needed some time to rest. Here are some of my thoughts from what I saw in Bourbonnais., Bears, 2019-08-02 20:07:12
Erik Lambert, People are picking on Mitch Trubisky a lot for not being sharp enough with his throw. I am here to say it's not all on him. Receivers had a bad tendency to drop passes run poor routes and not look for the ball quick enough to make a play on it.  #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-02 20:07:13
Erik Lambert, That said I can say this with total confidence. Trubisky and Allen Robinson are completely on the same page. I don't think they missed a single connection all morning. Every pass Mitch threw him was on target and caught. That duo is going to produce.  #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-02 20:07:13
Erik Lambert, As for Trubisky himself? He still has that tendency to get lazy with his fundamentals particularly when under pressure or throwing it deep. He's excellent at the short-to-intermediate range but forgets his feet sometimes in those situations. Still something to work on. #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-02 20:07:13
Erik Lambert, Javon Wims has not taken his foot off the gas in practice. Though he didn't make a lot of catches that was because the QBs weren't throwing it to him. He was open quite a bit. Though known mostly for his size he's actually faster than he looks. #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-02 20:07:13
Erik Lambert, The #Bears running backs are so much more dangerous in the passing game now. Tarik Cohen is obviously a threat but both David Montgomery and Mike Davis had nice plays in pass-catching drills. That dimension of the offense is about to pop wide open., Bears, 2019-08-02 20:07:14
Erik Lambert, Adam Shaheen returned for practice but was limited in reps probably to be careful with his back issue. He did have a nice play in red zone drills with a TD over Deon Bush. Still the tight ends did not make any significant impact plays especially with Trey Burton out.  #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-02 20:07:14
Erik Lambert, Khalil Mack makes it look way too easy. Every time he stepped on the field for a rep he created havoc. Bobby Massie had a nightmare blocking him. On one play Mack got into the backfield so fast that Chase Daniel basically just gave up and ate the sack. Beast.  #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-02 20:07:14
Erik Lambert, The surprise player who stood out to me was Joel Iyiegbuniwe. The second-year ILB is bigger now and hasn't lost any of his speed and quickness. Running backs could not block him in pass protection drills. Danny Trevathan is still the clear cut starter but Iggy is rising. #Bears, Bears, 2019-08-02 20:07:14
Erik Lambert, Throwing against that #Bears secondary is going to be torture for quarterbacks. Kyle Fuller and Prince Amukamara were all over WRs in drills creating turnovers. Eddie Jackson was on the prowl and Ha Ha Clinton-Dix had his first INT of camp. Everywhere you throw is ill-advised., Bears, 2019-08-02 20:07:15
Erik Lambert, Elliott Fry responded to Eddy Pineiro's strong Thursday practice with a near-flawless Friday. Both #Bears kickers have looked more than capable of being the starter on this team. Their battle will likely be decided in live game action during the preseason., Bears, 2019-08-02 20:07:15

קורנליוס, Kevin King is lowkey the most important piece at DB. If Kevin King is on the field the defense isn’t stressed; most QBs aren’t going to target a WR on a 6’3” CB more than a handful of times a game. #Packers, Packers, 2019-08-03 01:52:15

A Football Friend, Wouldn’t it be something if Witten becomes a backend TE1?  The year off to rest his body no doubt could only help. He wasn’t that athletic 2 years ago but when Zeke doesn’t play the #Cowboys will need red zone options &amp; TDs could help you win the TE position. #FantasyFootball, Cowboys FantasyFootball, 2019-08-03 01:53:17

קורנליוס, Offense doesn’t look all that behind as the beat has been reporting in live play situations. What’s more accurate from my POV is the defensive front seems to be ahead of the offensive line.
